Digitally signing files and messages to authenticate senders,Uses one key to encrypt blocks of text to be ciphered and another key to decrypt it back,Hashing is one-way cryptography in that you transform a meaningful plaintext into a meaningless but unique hash value but you cannot go from hash value back to the original meaning or plaintext,The certificate public key or both associated with the sender or author match what is associated with the file or message,The sender hashes the message or file to produce a message digest and applies the chosen decryption algorithm and their private key to it. This is the signature. The recipient uses the sender's public key and applies the corresponding encryption algorithm to the signature which will produce a matching message digest only if the message or file is authentically from the sender,Governments implement cryptographic module verifications programs which assure businesses that systems they use that contain such modules will meet regulatory and legal constraints for privacy data protection and product safety,No matter what kind of cryptanalytic attack the larger the key the larger the possible space of key values that an attacker must test; each additional binary bit doubles this search or testing time. Ultimately this requires more computing power and storage than even the most well-funded governments can afford,No because a hash is a many-to-one function and thus must have a collision detection and avoidance mechanism as part of its implementation; being reversible would negate this,Since much of the Internet is carried on long-haul backbone circuits that go via satellite encryption is used to protect data while being transmitted via radio through space to and from the satellite and ground stations. Without encryption anybody could receive these signals and break out the data being exchangedDespite traveling at the speed of light Internet traffic takes time to go from one user's system to another (i.e. from a client to a server); thus encryption protects the data in motion during this time,Cryptography cannot be used to reduce risks to information availability,Temporary staffing,RTO should be less than or equal to MAO,RPO,Plans represent significant investments and decisions and thus should be updated only when significant changes to objectives or circumstances dictate,ARO,MAO,We cannont run the risk that whatever caused the attack isn't dormant in your systems and that it wouldn't spread to our other systems or back out onto the Internet if we did thatYours are not the only systems affected by this attack; we've had to shut down most of our IT operations to make sure that our critical data and systems are protected,Indicators are events that are part of an information security incident kill chain; warnings are observable effects that we can detect that tell us of the occurrences of the indicator,Containment and eradication are separate and distinct tasks; once containment is complete the incident response team moves on to eradications of the causal agent(s),Anomalies in applications behavior,A,29,Male,Associates Degree or Technical School,Informal Training/Experience,Informal Training/Experience

We'd take them down and inspect them later when you're not using themWe have to comply with our policies that tell us how to handle incidents like this and so we can't do that,Indicators are the observable signals from an event which may suggest that an information systems security event may happen later,Containment primarily addresses shutting down connectivity between networks subnets systems and servers. Eradication addresses locating the causal agents (malware bogus user IDs etc.) and removing them from each system,Recurrent problems with data corruption in database entries,B,40,Female,Associates Degree or Technical School,None,None
Obscuring meaning by making it difficult or impossible for unauthorized users to access view copy or change it,Was used extensively in classical encryption but has since been superseded by much stronger asymmetric encryption,Hashing the contents of a file or message is the first step in producing a private key,The file or message has not been tampered with during transit or storage,The sender hashes the message or file to produce a message digest and applies the chosen decryption algorithm and their private key to it. This is the signature. The recipient uses the sender's public key and applies the corresponding encryption algorithm to the signature which will produce a matching message digest only if the message or file is authentically from the sender,Government policies and actions mean that most cryptographic systems available to business are easily broken when government needs to for law enforcement or national security needs,No matter what kind of cryptanalytic attack the larger the key the larger the possible space of key values that an attacker must test; each additional binary bit doubles this search or testing time. Ultimately this requires more computing power and storage than even the most well-funded governments can afford,No because this would allow the plaintext to be decrypted from the hash rendering message digests and digital signatures unworkable,By protecting data in transit (via Internet or other means) it protects data when en route between two or more physically separated points (in space)Since much of the Internet is carried on long-haul backbone circuits that go via satellite encryption is used to protect data while being transmitted via radio through space to and from the satellite and ground stations.
