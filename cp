Obscuring meaning by misdirection concealment or deception,Uses the same key or a simple transform of it to encrypt plaintext into ciphertext and to then decrypt the ciphertext back into plaintext,Hashing is one-way cryptography in that you transform a meaningful plaintext into a meaningless but unique hash value but you cannot go from hash value back to the original meaning or plaintext,The certificate public key or both associated with the sender or author match what is associated with the file or message,The sender hashes the message or file to produce a message digest and applies the chosen decryption algorithm and their private key to it. This is the signature. The recipient uses the sender's public key and applies the corresponding encryption algorithm to the signature which will produce a matching message digest only if the message or file is authentically from the sender,In many jurisdictions law and regulation place significant responsibilities for information protection and due diligence on businesses; these can only be met in practical ways by using cryptographic systems,No matter what kind of cryptanalytic attack the larger the key the larger the possible space of key values that an attacker must test; each additional binary bit doubles this search or testing time. Ultimately this requires more computing power and storage than even the most well-funded governments can afford,No because this would allow the plaintext to be decrypted from the hash rendering message digests and digital signatures unworkable,By protecting data in transit (via Internet or other means) it protects data when en route between two or more physically separated points (in space)Encrypting a file for storage ensures that it cannot be read or tampered with by unauthorized users or processes (which do not have the key); later authorized users with the key can read the file,Display of data to humans or output of data as device commands in control systems needs to be in an unecrypted for to be usableEven cryptographic support for nonrepudiation cannot prove that a recipient (authorized of not) actually read and understood or made use of the contents of a protected file or message; it can only prove that they accessed itUsers with legitimate access to a variety of information at one level of classification when decrypted for use may be able to infer the existence or value of information at higher levels of classification,Relocation of business operations to alternate sitesTemporary staffing,RTO should be less than or equal to MAO,RPO,Planning should continuously bring plans and procedures in tune with ongoing operational reality,ARO,RPO,We cannont run the risk that whatever caused the attack isn't dormant in your systems and that it wouldn't spread to our other systems or back out onto the Internet if we did thatYours are not the only systems affected by this attack; we've had to shut down most of our IT operations to make sure that our critical data and systems are protected,Precursors are the observable signals from an event which may suggest that an information systems security even may happen later,Containment and eradication usually involve the same tools and procedures and so they often are performed simultaneouslyMalware quarantine operations are an example of containment and eradication achieved with the same task,Routine ping or other ICMP packets coming to your systems
